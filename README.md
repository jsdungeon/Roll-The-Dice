Roll the dice game

This game has been created by myself during my (long) journey to learn C.
I introduced myself to functions and how to use them with even more then one return result.

The first version of the game is just creating 2 random numbers and compares them.
Some if / else commands do the comparison to determine if the computer or the player has won.

The next steps I am planning are:

+ Add more dice
+ Add statistics
+ Add more rules
+ Add ASCII graphics

(Far) In the future:

Switch from a console app to a window app.

I am coding and compiling this using Windows 10 and Visual Studio Community 2017
